# Summer-2017-cpp
I learned some basic java skills in first year of college and decided to apply basic concepts learned in java using cpp to create a tic 
tac toe game. I started off doing basic cpp exercises intended for beginners until I felt comfortable enough with the language to make a 
tic tac toe game.

The tic tac toe game is played using the console so it isn't anything fancy. It just prints out a board onto the console and each time a 
player makes a move, the updated board is printed out to the console.

There are two modes for the game, player vs player and player vs computer.
The player vs player mode, the players take turns inputting the row and column they want to place their X or O.
The player vs computer mode has two difficulties, easy or hard. In the easy mode, the computer just makes random moves so it is very
easy for the player to win. In the hard mode, the computer will always win or tie against the user since tic tac toe is a pretty simple  game and as long as both players know what they are doing, no one will win. Tic tac toe is a zero sum game.

For the player vs computer hard mode, it took a while to come up with all the conditions and rules that the computer needed to follow to 
make sure the game will always end up in a tie or a win for the computer. It was quite interesting and it would be nice to look more into
AI programming in the future.
